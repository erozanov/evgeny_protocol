Building a personal brand usually takes weeks of fiddling with templates. This time, I decided to treat my own site as a protocol experiment, developing it entirely through **Gemini CLI**.

### The Shift from Coding to Orchestrating

Working with an AI agent in the terminal isn't just about "generating code." It's about **architectural dialogue**. Instead of getting lost in Tailwind class strings or Astro component syntax, I focused on:

1.  **Intent:** Defining the "Brutalist" aesthetic and the "Digital Garden" concept.
2.  **Constraints:** Ensuring the site remains fast, accessible, and professional.
3.  **Iteration:** Shifting from "Drag-and-drop" to "Context-and-command."

### Why it works for Architects

As a Technical Manager, my day is often spent bridging the gap between vision and execution. Using an AI CLI tool mirrors this perfectly. I provide the high-level logic and constraints, and the agent handles the heavy lifting of implementation while I maintain oversight.

### The Result

The site you are looking at was built in hours, not days. But more importantly, every line of code was debated and refined through a continuous loop of feedback. 

**This is the new developer protocol: Vision + AI Orchestration.**
