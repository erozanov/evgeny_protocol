Software systems are complex, but the thoughts behind them are even more chaotic. As an architect, my job is to impose order on this chaos.

### The Problem with Linear Notes

Traditional blogs are chronological. They imply that your newest thought is the most important. But in system design, an idea from three years ago might be the missing piece for a protocol I'm building today.

### Building the Network

A digital garden allows for non-linear growth. By using internal links, I can connect high-level strategy with low-level implementation details.

For example, my recent experiment with [[developing-with-gemini-cli]] showed me that the speed of implementing an idea is now tied directly to the clarity of the architectural prompt.

### Why "Garden" instead of "Blog"?

1.  **Imperfection:** Notes can be "seedlings" (rough ideas).
2.  **Growth:** I can update a note as my understanding of a protocol evolves.
3.  **Discovery:** You don't read a garden; you wander through it.
